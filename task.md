Stage 4 Backend Task: Microservices & Message Queues
Task Title: Distributed Notification System
Goal/Objective:
Build a notification system that sends emails and push notifications using separate microservices. Each service should communicate asynchronously through a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).
Task Execution
You will be working as a group in teams of 4.
Airtable link
You’re required to write the CI/CD workflow for deployment.
Request/Response/Model naming convention should be snake_case.
To request for a server for deployment use the command /request-server

Services to Build
1. API Gateway Service
Entry point for all notification requests
Validates and authenticates requests
Routes messages to the correct queue (email or push)
Tracks notification status
2. User Service
Manages user contact info (email, push tokens)
Stores notification preferences
Handles login and permissions
Exposes REST APIs for user data
3. Email Service
Reads messages from the email queue
Fills templates with variables (e.g., {{name}})
Send emails using SMTP or APIs (SendGrid, Mailgun, Gmail)
Handles delivery confirmations and bounces
4. Push Service
Reads messages from the push queue
Sends mobile or web push notifications
Validates device tokens
Supports rich notifications (title, text, image, link)
Free Push Options: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), OneSignal (Free Plan), Web Push with VAPID (Self-Hosted)
5. Template Service
Stores and manages notification templates
Handles variable substitution
Supports multiple languages
Keeps version history for templates
Message Queue Setup
 Example (RabbitMQ):
 Exchange: notifications.direct
 ├── email.queue  → Email Service
 ├── push.queue   → Push Service
 └── failed.queue → Dead Letter Queue
Response format:
 {
  success: boolean
  data?: T
  error?: string
  message: string
  meta: PaginationMeta
}

interface PaginationMeta {
  total: number
  limit: number
  page: number
  total_pages: number
  has_next: boolean
  has_previous: boolean
}
Key Technical Concepts
Circuit Breaker
Prevents total system failure when a service (like SMTP or FCM) goes down.
3. Retry System
Retry failed messages with exponential backoff and move permanently failed messages to the dead-letter queue.
4. Service Discovery
Allows services to find each other dynamically.
5. Health Checks
Each service should have a /health endpoint for status monitoring.
6. Idempotency
Prevent duplicate notifications by using unique request IDs.
7. Service Communication
Synchronous (REST): User preference lookups, Template retrieval, Status queries
Asynchronous (Message Queue): Notification processing, Retry handling, Status updates
Data Storage Strategy
Each service uses its own database:
User Service: PostgreSQL (user data, preferences)
Template Service: PostgreSQL (templates, versions)
Notification Services: Local cache + shared status store
Shared Tools: Redis for caching user preferences, managing rate limits etc. and RabbitMQ/Kafka for async message queuing
Failure Handling
Service Failures: Circuit breaker prevents cascading issues and other services continue running.
Message Processing Failures: Automatic retries with exponential backoff, permanent failures go to the dead-letter queue.
Network Issues: Use local cache and continue essential operations gracefully.
Monitoring & Logs
Track Metrics: Message rate per queue, Service response times, Error rates, Queue length and lag.
Logging: Use correlation IDs and log every notification’s lifecycle.
System Design Diagram
Each team must submit a simple diagram showing: Service connections, Queue structure, Retry and failure flow, Database relationships, Scaling plan.
You can use Draw.io, Miro, or Lucidchart (free tools).
Performance Targets
Handle 1,000+ notifications per minute
API Gateway response under 100ms
99.5% delivery success rate
All services support horizontal scaling.
Recommended Tech Stack
Languages: PHP, Node.js (!express), Python, Go, or Java (Any language of your choice is welcomed)
Queue: RabbitMQ or Kafka
Database: PostgreSQL + Redis
Containerization: Docker
API Docs: OpenAPI or Swagger
Learning Outcomes
This stage teaches:
Microservices decomposition
Asynchronous messaging patterns
Distributed system failure handling
Event-driven architecture design
Scalable and fault-tolerant notification systems
Team work and collaboration
